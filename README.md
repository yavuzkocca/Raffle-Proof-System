# Description

This application enables a user to enter a Raffle on a contract on OP Sepolia. After the raffle is completed, the winner gets a ERC-721 NFT for free on Base Sepolia even though the users entered via OP Sepolia.


Features:

Uses Polymer x IBC as the cross-chain format

Commits to the spirit of application specific chains/rollups where entering the raffle function can be specialized on one chain, NFT distribution to the winner of the raffle on another and both can form composable applications through interoperability.

# Resources used
The repo uses the ibc-app-solidity-template as starting point and adds custom contracts Raffle and RaffleNFT that implement the custom logic.

It changes the send-packet.js script slightly to adjust to the custom logic.

Additional resources used:

Hardhat

Blockscout

# Steps
After cloning the repo, install dependencies:
```bash
just install
```
And add your private key to the .env file (rename it from .env.example).

Then make sure that the config has the right contracts:

```bash
just set-contracts optimism Raffle && \
just set-contracts base RaffleNFT
```
Compile Contracts:
```bash
just compile
```

## Deployment and Creating channels

Then you can deploy the contract if you want to have a custom version, but you can use the provided contract addresses that are prefilled in the config. 
If you want to deploy your own, run:

```bash
just deploy optimism base false
```

then verify contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat --network optimism verify <ContractAddress> "0x58f1863f75c9db1c7266dc3d7b43832b58f35e83"
```

```bash
npx hardhat --network base verify <ContractAddress> "0xfc1d3e02e00e0077628e8cc9edb6812f95db05dc" "https://i.ibb.co/3y0SGCH/winner-nft.webp"
```

and create a channel:

```bash
just create-channel
```

Wait for config.json update

# Challenges Faced
Debugging was a bit tricky when the sendPacket part worked fine on the contract, but there was a problem later with the packet.
